# Planning App

This is a planning app, written in Python using the Django Framework. My goal in creating this application was to
make a multi-faceted application where users could create accounts, add, update and delete entries as they please.
Users of the app have the opportunity to create tasks in the to-do section of the site, write their goals down in the
goals section, create a book list, and list some of their favorite quotes. The majority of the application was written in
Python and HTML, as well as Bootstrap to improve the look of the site.
